# Perceptron
 An implementation of perceptron algorithm from scratch.

 The objective was to perform perceptron algorithm for any number of given datapoints and adding a minimum number of data points to make the dataset non-linearly separable.  
 
 For this purpose, the given dtapoints were- 

 D = ([(1; 1); +1]; [(2;􀀀2);􀀀1]; [(􀀀1;􀀀1:5);􀀀1]; [(􀀀2;􀀀1);􀀀1]; [(􀀀2; 1); +1]; [(1:5;􀀀0:5); +1])
 
 Result of each iteration is plotted with the datapoints till convergence is achieved.
